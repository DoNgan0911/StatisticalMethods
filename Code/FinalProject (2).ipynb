She has tried many different diets, but is unsuccessful.  She has been to our Bariatric Surgery Seminar, received some handouts, and signed the consent.  The risks and benefits of the procedure have been explained to the patient.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  ,The patient was taken to the operating room and placed supine on the operating room table.  All pressure points were carefully padded.  She was given general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.  SCD stockings were placed on both legs.  Foley catheter was placed for bladder decompression.  The abdomen was then prepped and draped in standard sterile surgical fashion.  Marcaine was then injected through umbilicus.  A small incision was made.  A Veress needle was introduced into the abdomen.  CO2 insufflation was done to a maximum pressure of 15 mmHg.  A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus.  I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side.  I placed another 5-mm port in the midclavicular line just subcostal on the right side, a few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 12-mm VersaStep port.  On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port.  A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port.  I began by lifting up the omentum and identifying the transverse colon and lifting that up and thereby identifying my ligament of Treitz.  I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler.  I then divided the mesentery all the way down to the base of the mesentery with a LigaSure device.  I then ran the distal bowel down, approximately 100 cm, and at 100 cm, I made a hole at the antimesenteric portion of the Roux limb and a hole in the antimesenteric portion of the duodenogastric limb, and I passed a 45 white load stapler and fired a stapler creating a side-to-side anastomosis.  I reapproximated the edges of the defect.  I lifted it up and stapled across it with another white load stapler.  I then closed the mesenteric defect with interrupted Surgidac sutures.  I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic.  I then put the patient in reverse Trendelenburg.  I placed a liver retractor, identified, and dissected the angle of His.  I then dissected on the lesser curve, approximately 2.5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction, and got into a lesser space.  I fired transversely across the stomach with a 45 blue load stapler.  I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.  I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil.  I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler.  I passed that in the end of my Roux limb and had the spike come out antimesenteric.  I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag.  I put some additional 2-0 Vicryl sutures in the anastomosis for further security.  I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel.  I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch.  I distended gastric pouch with air.  There was no air leak seen.  I could pass the scope easily through the anastomosis.  There was no bleeding seen through the scope.  We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason.  I copiously irrigated out that incision with about 2 L of saline.  I then closed the skin of all incisions with running Monocryl.  Sponge, instrument, and needle counts were correct at the end of the case.  The patient tolerated the procedure well without any complications.\",\n          \"CHIEF COMPLAINT:,  Urinary retention.,HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: , This is a 66-year-old gentleman status post deceased donor kidney transplant in 12/07, who has had recurrent urinary retention issues since that time.

Breast asymmetry.,POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSES,1.  Surgical absence of left nipple areola with personal history of breast cancer.,2.  Breast asymmetry.,PROCEDURE,1.  Left nipple areolar reconstruction utilizing a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin.,2.  Redo right mastopexy.,ANESTHESIA,General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS,None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position and after suitable induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a frog-leg position and prepped and draped in usual fashion for the above-noted procedure.  The initial portion of the procedure was harvesting a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin region.  This was accomplished by ellipsing out a 42-mm diameter circle of skin just below the thigh, peroneal crease.  The defect was then closed with 3-0 Vicryl followed by 3-0 chromic suture in a running locked fashion.  The area was dressed with antibiotic ointment and then a Peri-Pad.  The patient's legs were brought out frog-leg back to the midline and sterile towels were placed over the opening in the drapes.  Surgical team's gloves were changed and then attention was turned to the planning of the left nipple flap.,A maltese cross pattern was employed with a 1-cm diameter nipple and a 42-mm diameter nipple areolar complex.  Once the maltese cross had been designed on the breast at the point where the nipple was to be placed, the areas of the portion of flap were de-epithelialized.  Then, when this had been completed, the dermis about the maltese cross was incised full thickness to allow mobilization of the flap to form the neonipple.  At this point, a Bovie electrocautery was used to control bleeding points and then 4-0 chromic suture was used to suture the arms of the flap together creating the nipple.  When this had been completed, the skin graft, which had been harvested from the left groin was brought onto the field where it was prepared by removing all subcutaneous tissue from the posterior aspect of the graft and carefully removing the hair follicles encountered within the graft.  At this point, the graft was sutured into position in the defect using 3-0 chromic in an interrupted fashion and then trimming the ellipse to an appropriate circle to fill the areola.  At this point, 4-0 chromic was used to run around the perimeter of the full-thickness skin graft and then at this point the nipple was delivered through a cruciate incision in the middle of the skin graft and then inset appropriately with 4-0 chromic.  The areolar skin graft was pie crusted.  Then, at this point, the area of areola was dressed with silicone gel sheeting.  A silo was placed over the neonipple with 3-0 nylon through the apex of the neonipple to support the nipple in an erect position.  Mastisol and Steri-Strips were then applied.,At this point, attention was turned to the right breast where a 2-cm wide ellipse transversely oriented and with its inferior most aspect just inferior to the transverse mastopexy incision line was made.  The skin was removed from the area and then a layered closure of 3-0 Vicryl followed by 3-0 PDS in a running subcuticular fashion was carried out.  When this had been completed, the Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied to the transverse right breast incision.  Fluff dressings were applied to the right breast as well as the area around the silo on the left breast around the reconstructed nipple areola.  The patient was then placed in Surgi-Bra and then was taken from the operating room to the recovery room in good condition.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"cosmetic / plastic surgery, nipple areola, breast asymmetry, general endotracheal, peri-pad, surgi-bra, breast cancer, frog-leg position, full-thickness skin graft, general endotracheal anesthesia, mastopexy, nipple areolar complex, nipple areolar reconstruction, nipple flap, prepped and draped, transverse mastopexy, areolar reconstruction, skin graft, graft, nipple, areolar, breast\",\n          \"bariatrics, gastric bypass, eea anastomosis, roux-en-y, antegastric, antecolic, morbid obesity, roux limb, gastric pouch, intubation, laparoscopic, bypass, roux, endotracheal, anastomosis, gastric\",\n          \"bariatrics, laparoscopic gastric bypass, heart attacks, body weight, pulmonary embolism, potential complications, sleep study, weight loss, gastric bypass, anastomosis, loss, sleep, laparoscopic, gastric, bypass, heart, pounds, weight,\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

At this point, 4-0 chromic was used to run around the perimeter of the full-thickness skin graft and then at this point the nipple was delivered through a cruciate incision in the middle of the skin graft and then inset appropriately with 4-0 chromic. Surgical absence of left nipple areola with personal history of breast cancer.,2. Surgical absence of left nipple areola with personal history of breast cancer.,2. Fluff dressings were applied to the right breast as well as the area around the silo on the left breast around the reconstructed nipple areola. The initial portion of the procedure was harvesting a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin region. Once the maltese cross had been designed on the breast at the point where the nipple was to be placed, the areas of the portion of flap were de-epithelialized. Surgical team's gloves were changed and then attention was turned to the planning of the left nipple flap.,A maltese cross pattern was employed with a 1-cm diameter nipple and a 42-mm diameter nipple areolar complex. At this point, the graft was sutured into position in the defect using 3-0 chromic in an interrupted fashion and then trimming the ellipse to an appropriate circle to fill the areola. Breast asymmetry.,PROCEDURE,1. Redo right mastopexy.,ANESTHESIA,General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS,None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position and after suitable induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a frog-leg position and prepped and draped in usual fashion for the above-noted procedure. When this had been completed, the Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied to the transverse right breast incision. Mastisol and Steri-Strips were then applied.,At this point, attention was turned to the right breast where a 2-cm wide ellipse transversely oriented and with its inferior most aspect just inferior to the transverse mastopexy incision line was made. When this had been completed, the skin graft, which had been harvested from the left groin was brought onto the field where it was prepared by removing all subcutaneous tissue from the posterior aspect of the graft and carefully removing the hair follicles encountered within the graft. Then, at this point, the area of areola was dressed with silicone gel sheeting.\",\n",

I joined the spike with the anvil and fired a stapler creating an end-to-side anastomosis, then divided across the redundant portion of my Roux limb with a white load GI stapler, and removed it with an Endocatch bag. A few centimeters below and medial to that, I placed a 15-mm port. I then placed a 5-mm port just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal on the right side. A 12-mm VersaStep port was placed through the umbilicus. On the left side, just anterior to the midaxillary line and just subcostal, I placed a 5-mm port. I ran the small bowel down approximately 40 cm and divided the small bowel with a white load GIA stapler. I pulled the anvil into place, and I then opened up my 15-mm port site and passed my EEA stapler. We closed the 15-mm port site with interrupted 0 Vicryl suture utilizing Carter-Thomason. I then placed a bowel clamp across the bowel. I then made a hole at the base of the gastric pouch and had Anesthesia remove the bougie and place the OG tube connected to the anvil. I went above and passed an EGD scope into the mouth down to the esophagus and into the gastric pouch. I divided the omentum all the way down to the colon in order to create a passageway for my small bowel to go antecolic. I then used two fires of the 60 blue load with SeamGuard to go up into my angle of His, thereby creating my gastric pouch.',\n",

Surgical absence of left nipple areola with personal history of breast cancer.,2. Surgical absence of left nipple areola with personal history of breast cancer.,2. Fluff dressings were applied to the right breast as well as the area around the silo on the left breast around the reconstructed nipple areola. The initial portion of the procedure was harvesting a full-thickness skin graft from the left groin region. Once the maltese cross had been designed on the breast at the point where the nipple was to be placed, the areas of the portion of flap were de-epithelialized. Surgical team's gloves were changed and then attention was turned to the planning of the left nipple flap.,A maltese cross pattern was employed with a 1-cm diameter nipple and a 42-mm diameter nipple areolar complex. At this point, the graft was sutured into position in the defect using 3-0 chromic in an interrupted fashion and then trimming the ellipse to an appropriate circle to fill the areola.

Redo right mastopexy.,ANESTHESIA,General endotracheal.,COMPLICATIONS,None.,DESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE IN DETAIL,The patient was brought to the operating room and placed on the table in the supine position and after suitable induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, the patient was placed in a frog-leg position and prepped and draped in usual fashion for the above-noted procedure. When this had been completed, the Mastisol and Steri-Strips were applied to the transverse right breast incision. Mastisol and Steri-Strips were then applied.,At this point, attention was turned to the right breast where a 2-cm wide ellipse transversely oriented and with its inferior most aspect just inferior to the transverse mastopexy incision line was made. When this had been completed, the skin graft, which had been harvested from the left groin was brought onto the field where it was prepared by removing all subcutaneous tissue from the posterior aspect of the graft and carefully removing the hair follicles encountered within the graft. Then, at this point, the area of areola was dressed with \n",
